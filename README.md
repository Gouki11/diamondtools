Diamond Tool modlet for 7daystodie.
Initial version of diamond tools modlet I created. (Working on Icons right now)
Feel free to let me know on bugs or ideas to add too this little modlet.
If you would like to use my code to modify or use in your own way. Just ask me, maybe we can create a better modlet for all.
The Icons I found on my old desktop in my 7daystodie folder. I do not take created for the Icon Images.

Adding diamond armor in a seperate modlet soon but after all bugs and such are error free and stable on a19 I will combined all my modlets into one pack.
